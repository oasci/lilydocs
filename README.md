## Requirements

-   Hugo **Extended** (>=v0.120.0)
-   Go (>=v1.20)
-   git

## Installation

The Lily Docs theme can be installed using one of the following methods.
You must first have a Hugo site; for example, we create a new site called `quick site`.

```bash
hugo new site quicksite
cd quicksite
```

An initialized git repository is also necessary.

```bash
git init
```

### Install as a Git Submodule

If you prefer to install the Lily Docs theme as a Git submodule, follow these steps:

1.  Open your terminal and navigate to the root directory of your Hugo project.

2.  Add the Lily Docs theme as a Git submodule by running the following command:

   ```bash
   git submodule add https://gitlab.com/oasci/lilydocs themes/lilydocs
   ```

   This command will create a `themes` directory (if it doesn't already exist) and clone the Lily Docs theme repository into the `themes/lilydocs` directory.

3.  Open the `hugo.toml` configuration file in your project's root directory and add the following lines:

   ```toml
   baseURL = 'http://example.org/'  # Change this to your site's url
   languageCode = 'en-us'
   title = 'My New Hugo Site'  # Change this to your site's name

   [module]
       # uncomment line below for temporary local development of module
       # or when using a 'theme' as a git submodule
       replacements = "gitlab.com/oasci/lilydocs -> lilydocs"
       [[module.imports]]
           path = "gitlab.com/oasci/lilydocs"
           disable = false
       [[module.imports]]
           path = "github.com/gohugoio/hugo-mod-bootstrap-scss/v5"
           disable = false
   ```

   The `replacements` line tells Hugo to use the submodule located in the `themes/lilydocs` directory instead of fetching it from the remote repository.

4.  Save the changes to the `hugo.toml` file.

Remember to commit the changes to your project's repository after adding the submodule:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add Lily Docs theme as a submodule"
```

### Locally

There may be cases where you prefer to customize and maintain the Lily Docs theme yourself.
In such cases, use `git` to clone the theme into the `themes/lilydocs` directory.

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/oasci/lilydocs themes/lilydocs
```

Edit the `hugo.toml` config file:

```toml
baseURL = 'http://example.org/'
languageCode = 'en-us'
title = 'My New Hugo Site'

[module]
    # uncomment line below for temporary local development of module,
    # when using a 'theme' as a git submodule or git cloned files
    replacements = "gitlab.com/oasci/lilydocs -> lilydocs"
    [[module.imports]]
        path = "gitlab.com/oasci/lilydocs"
        disable = false
    [[module.imports]]
        path = "github.com/gohugoio/hugo-mod-bootstrap-scss/v5"
        disable = false
```

## Create New Content

Navigate to the root of your Hugo project and use the `hugo new` command to create a file in the `content/docs` directory:

```shell
hugo new docs/example-page.md
```

This will create a markdown file named `example-page.md` with the following default front matter:

```yaml
---
title: "Example Page"
description: ""
icon: "article"
date: "2023-05-22T00:27:57+01:00"
lastmod: "2023-05-22T00:27:57+01:00"
draft: false
toc: true
weight: 999
---
```

Modify the above front matter options to suit your needs.

## Preview your site locally

Now that you've created some sample content you can preview your new Lily Docs site using the `huge server` command:

```shell
hugo server -D
```

Navigate to [https://localhost:1313/docs/](https://localhost:1313/docs/) and you should see a card link to the **Example Page** created earlier:
